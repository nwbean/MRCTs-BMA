bma_functions_tte_endpoint.R - R code with functions to calculate different forms
   of consistency



BMA_LEADER_analysis.R - R code that runs proposed BMA approach using data from the
   LEADER trial



bma-asymptotic-function.R - R code containing main function that runs proposed BMA
   approach algorithm using Laplace approximation



competitor-model-analyses.sas - SAS code to recreate (1) the original analysis using Cox
   proportional hazards models as described in the study protocol and (2) the FDA's post
