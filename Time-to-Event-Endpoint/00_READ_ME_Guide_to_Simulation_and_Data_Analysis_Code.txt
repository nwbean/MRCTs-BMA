GUIDE TO SIMULATION AND DATA ANALYSIS CODE:


This file contains three folders with all code used in the simulation studies and in the
analysis of the LEADER trial data (data and code used to prepare the data not included).
All simulation studies discussed in the main paper and the Supporting Information can be
reproduced using the files provided. Additionally, an example is included in which users
can execute the BMA approach for a simulated dataset, and R code is provided to serve as
a template in which users can run the BMA approach for their own datasets. All subfolders
contain additional READ_ME files to further clarify their contents.


Folders:

example-analysis - code that serves as an example in which users can run the algorithm
   for the BMA approach using a simulated dataset. An additional template R script is
   included in which users can upload their own datasets, choose model details (e.g.,
   the number of time intervals when defining the piecewise constant baseline hazards),
   choose prior hyperparameter values, and then run the BMA approach



LEADER-trial-analysis-code - R code used to run the BMA approach on the LEADER trial data
   and SAS code to run the original analysis and the FDA's post hoc analysis. The data
   and any code used to prepare the data are not included



simulations-code - code and all other files needed to reproduce the simulation results
   discussed in the main paper and the Supporting Information
