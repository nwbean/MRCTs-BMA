GUIDE TO SIMULATION AND DATA ANALYSIS CODE:


This file contains two folders with all code used in the simulation studies and in an
example analysis of a simluated dataset. All simulation studies discussed in the main
paper and the Supplementary Materials can be reproduced using the files provided. All
subfolders contain additional READ_ME files to further clarify their contents.


Folders:


example-analysis - R code used to run the BMA approach on either a simulated dataset or
   a real dataset that can be uploaded.



simulations-code - code and a simulated example dataset needed to reproduce the simulation
   results discussed in the main paper and the Supplementary Materials
