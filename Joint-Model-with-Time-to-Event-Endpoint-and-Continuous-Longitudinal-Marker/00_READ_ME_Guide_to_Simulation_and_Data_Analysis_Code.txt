GUIDE TO SIMULATION AND DATA ANALYSIS CODE:


This file contains two folders with all code used in the simulation studies and in the
analysis of the LEADER trial data (data and code used to prepare the data not included).
All simulation studies discussed in the main paper and the Supplementary Materials can be
reproduced using the files provided. All subfolders contain additional READ_ME files to
further clarify their contents.


Folders:


example-analysis - R code used to run the BMA approach on either a simulated dataset or
   a real dataset that can be uploaded.



simulations-code - code and all other files needed to reproduce the simulation results
   discussed in the main paper and the Supplementary Materials
