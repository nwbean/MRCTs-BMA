GUIDE TO CLUSTER LOG:


Folders for each simulation study in which R logs with simulation details and output can be saved.

Note that these folders must be created prior to running simulations with batch scripts (see the
folder "cluster-scripts"). In this folder "cluster-log", however, I did not keep the R logs (i.e.,
the folders are empty).
